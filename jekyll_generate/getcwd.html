		<h1>getcwd</h1>
		JNI (Java Native Interface) library to get the current working directory from which the<br>
		JVM (Java Virtual Machine) was invoked.<br><br>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		The project shows how to create and use an own native method from within Java, using the JNI.<br><br>
		In very short only three (main) steps are needed for the implementation<br><br>
		1. write a Java class which declares a native method<br>
		2. generate a C/C++ header file from the Java class file<br>
		3. write a C/C++ library which implements the method<br><br>
		After compiling the library you're done and able to use it.<br><br>
		For a more detailed explanation and instructions see the files in this project.<br><br>
		<h3>Features</h3>
		* the included test demonstrate that the Java system property "user.dir" is not always<br>
		  a reliable source to get the JVM invokation directory<br>
